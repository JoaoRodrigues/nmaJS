## About
This code is a demonstration of how to run somewhat complex calculations on 'large' molecules
entirely on the browser, assisted by WebAssembly. We hope this repository serves as a guide
for others to implement their own algorithms and develop user-friendly tools for molecular
modeling.

We use [3Dmol.js](https://3dmol.csb.pitt.edu/) for visualization, a great library with
a phenomenal documentation.
