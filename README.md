Normal Mode Analysis of Protein Structure implemented in JavaScript

## About
Implementation of a simple coarse-grained elastic network model for normal mode 
analysis of protein structures. Written in JavaScript, using [LALOLib](http://mlweb.loria.fr/lalolab/lalolib.html)
and [NGL](https://github.com/arose/ngl/) for eigendecomposition of the Kirchoff matrix and visualization, respectively.

Algorithmic similarities to [ProDy](prody.csb.pitt.edu) are *not* a coincidence.
