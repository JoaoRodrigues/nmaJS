Normal Mode Analysis of Protein Structure implemented in JavaScript

## About
Implementation of a simple coarse-grained elastic network model for normal mode 
analysis of protein structures. Written in JavaScript, using [JSFeat](https://github.com/inspirit/jsfeat)
for eigendecomposition of the Kirchoff matrix and [NGL](https://github.com/arose/ngl/) for structure visualization and manipulation.

Algorithmic similarities to [ProDy](https://prody.csb.pitt.edu) are *not* a coincidence.
